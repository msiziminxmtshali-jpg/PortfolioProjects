## Maji Ndongo (national water survey)

1. Project Objective
The government of Maji Ndogo has collected data on water sources across the country. Your task is to build a Power BI dashboard that:

        Identifies which citizens lack access to basic water.
        Diagnoses the problem (Pollution? Broken infrastructure? Long wait times?).
       Calculates a budget to fix these issues (typically capped around $147 Million).
        Tracks the progress of the engineering teams fixing the sources.
